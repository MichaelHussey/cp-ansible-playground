# CP-Ansible playground

A way of messing around with cp-ansible using local docker containers

## Introduction

We often recommend the use of [cp-ansible](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-ansible) for creating Confluent Platform environments.
It contains a testing framework called Molecule (see [here](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-ansible/blob/6.1.0-post/HOW_TO_TEST.md)) and we provide a large number of pre-configured configurations in [roles/confluent.test/molecule](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-ansible/tree/6.1.0-post/roles/confluent.test/molecule)

This works great, but it mixes the inventory into the middle of a larger molecule.yml file.
Often if someone gives you a hosts.yml file and needs help in figuring out why it doesn't work it would be nice to just take that file as is and run cp-ansible to deploy it onto some inventory.

This project uses docker-compose to create that inventory as a bunch of local docker containers running centos7.

First grab a copy of cp-ansible into the directory where you put this stuff
````
git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-ansible.git
````
Then make sure you have as many instances of ansible_target in the docker-compose.yml as there are unique hosts in the hosts.yml file, and set the hostnames to those seen in the hosts.yml file.

Start the inventory (the first time around you should see it build your container images) and then exec into the 'ansible' one.
````
docker-compose up -d
docker-composeÂ  exec ansible /bin/bash
````

Now you need to grab some public keys from the target machines
````
cd /data
./fix_known_hosts.sh
````
Now you can run the playbooks
````
cd /data/cp-ansible
ansible-playbook -i ../hosts_minimum_1.yml all.yml
````

When you're finished clean up with
````
docker-compose down -v --rmi all --remove-orphans
````
