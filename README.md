# CP-Ansible playground

A way of messing around with cp-ansible using local docker containers

## Introduction

We often recommend the use of [cp-ansible](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-ansible) for creating Confluent Platform environments.
It contains a testing framework called Molecule (see [here](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-ansible/blob/6.1.0-post/HOW_TO_TEST.md)) and we provide a large number of pre-configured configurations in [roles/confluent.test/molecule](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-ansible/tree/6.1.0-post/roles/confluent.test/molecule)

This works great, but it mixes the inventory into the middle of a larger molecule.yml file.
Often if someone gives you a hosts.yml file and needs help in figuring out why it doesn't work it would be nice to just take that file as is and run **cp-ansible** to deploy it onto some inventory.

This project uses docker-compose to create that inventory as a bunch of local docker containers running centos7.

## Getting started

First grab a copy of cp-ansible into the directory where you put this stuff
````
git clone https://github.com/MichaelHussey/cp-ansible-playground.git
cd cp-ansible-playground
git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-ansible.git
````

Create a local ssh private key without a password
````
cat /dev/zero | ssh-keygen -t RSA -C "SSH key for ansible testing" -f ./sshkey -q -N ""
cp sshkey.pub ansible_target_base/
cp sshkey ansible_host/
````

## Prepare the inventory

Assuming someone has given you a hosts.yml file, or you have created your own one - this defines how you want Confluent Platform to be deployed across a bunch of machines. These machines are the *inventory*.

Make sure you have as many instances of *ansible_target* in the *docker-compose.yml* as there are unique hosts in the hosts.yml file, and set the hostnames to those seen in the hosts.yml file. Also update *fix_known_hosts.sh* to match the list of host names.

Also check what username the ansible playbooks should be run under, in this case it's **D003446** and edit the *docker-compose-yml* file to set *ansible_user* to that value in the *target* container.


Start the inventory (the first time around you should see it build your container images).
````
docker-compose up -d
````
This should give you a container where you run ansible from, the expected number of target containers running, plus 2 stopped intermediate containers.
````
docker-compose ps   
             Name                        Command            State                        Ports                     
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ansible                          /usr/lib/systemd/systemd   Up                                                     
cp-ansible-playground_dummy_1    /bin/sh -c echo            Exit 0                                                 
cp-ansible-playground_target_1   /bin/sh -c echo            Exit 0                                                 
cp1                              /usr/lib/systemd/systemd   Up       0.0.0.0:9021->9021/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9093->9093/tcp
cp2                              /usr/lib/systemd/systemd   Up       0.0.0.0:19093->9093/tcp                       
cp3                              /usr/lib/systemd/systemd   Up       0.0.0.0:29093->9093/tcp 
````

## Run your playbooks!

First *exec* into the **ansible** container.
````
docker-composeÂ exec ansible /bin/bash
````
Now you need to grab some public keys from the target machines
````
cd /data
./fix_known_hosts.sh
````
Now you can run the playbooks
````
cd /data/cp-ansible
ansible-playbook -i ../hosts_minimum_1.yml all.yml
````
You can deploy and re-deploy to your heart's content and run whatever tests you need to check the cluster works correctly.

## Cleaning up

When you're finished clean up with
````
docker-compose down -v --rmi all --remove-orphans
````
This removes all the locally built images. If you want to just change the inventory (add a few containers, change host names etc) then it's enough to do
````
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
````
and you have a completely clean set of docker containers ready to rebuild the environment by running **cp-ansible** again.
